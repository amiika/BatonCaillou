# Bâton Caillou

_Bâton Caillou_ is a canvas grid mimicking [ORCA](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca) user interface. I just wanted to program it to see if I could then come up with a new different sequencer using the same format. This project does **NOTHING** for the moment. I also see it as a way to teach myself some JavaScript.

# TODO

- [ ] Better font!
- [ ] Proper scaling for the canvas (it is blurry and not nice to Retina screens)

- [ ] Superior command line / writing zone
